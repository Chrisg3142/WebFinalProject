                            <h3>Who we are</h3> 
                            <p> Tech Bank was founded by Christopher Gutama and it is a hispanic lead bank, we love to give back to our communities. 
                                We began in 2009 and we started small in one building helping people in the area but then we expanded and opened multiple buildings. 
                                We love to have a supportive community and we love to support our community by helping out local shops or donating for community events so everyone can have fun in our area.
                            </p> 
                            <h3>What we do</h3> 
                            <p> We are tech bank, we help people with low income when they do not know what to do with their money. 
                                We offer high rates for our savings cards so you can leave your money to make you money without having 
                                to think about it once you put your money in the account. We love to help all our different communities 
                                by representing them all in our workplace both at our bank locations and our offices. We love to spread positivity 
                                and make sure that everyone that walks into our buildings are treated how they should be and leave with a smile knowing 
                                that they are getting the best rates. We hold financial workshops for children and adults so they can learn how money works 
                                and what they can do to make more or save money. We try to make sure everyone has a fair chance to make money since not everyone 
                                is taught how their money works and what they can do with it other than spend it. 
                            </p> 
                            <h3>Why we do it</h3> 
                            <p>We at Tech Bank help our community because we like to give back to the community and we love to help people advance in their career if 
                                they want to work with us. We are driven by our passion to help people even if it is just with the smaller part of their life, we try to 
                                provide financial support for those who do not know how to make their money make money or if they are just unsure how things work and if 
                                they want to learn we are available to help them and give them resources to learn more than what we teach .
